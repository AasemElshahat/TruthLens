## Strategic Decision: 7-Agent Hybrid Team with Technical Product Manager

After critical evaluation of complexity vs. value, we've evolved to a **7-Agent Hybrid Team** that combines advisory guidance with implementation capability, orchestrated by a Technical Product Manager.

### **Agent Philosophy: Advisory-Implementation Specialists**

Our agents function as **hybrid advisory-implementation specialists** who:
- **Advise** by challenging approaches and presenting alternatives
- **Implement** by building TruthLens components with technical excellence
- **Educate** through transparent reasoning during both advisory and implementation phases
- **Collaborate** in decision-making while taking ownership of execution
- **Orchestrate** through Technical Product Manager for coordination and documentation

This hybrid approach addresses the entrepreneur's need for both strategic guidance AND implementation capability, managed through a single orchestrator to prevent overwhelming complexity.

## Why 7 Agents (Not 15, Not 5)?

### **Strategic Reasoning:**
- **Optimal Complexity**: Comprehensive coverage without overwhelming coordination overhead
- **Hybrid Capability**: Each agent both advises strategically AND implements solutions
- **Clear Orchestration**: Technical Product Manager eliminates coordination confusion
- **Manageable Relationships**: 7 specialists with 1 primary interface (TPM)
- **Professional Objectivity**: Deep expertise combined with respectful challenge capabilities
- **Bootstrap to Enterprise**: Scales from thesis foundation to commercial product
- **Educational Implementation**: Agents teach while building, maximizing learning value

### **Key Design Decisions:**
1. **Technical Product Manager**: Single orchestrator for coordination, documentation, and GitHub issue management
2. **Domain Consolidation**: Strategic combination of complementary specializations (e.g., Security + Performance)
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Each specialist provides both advisory guidance AND implementation capability
4. **Thesis + Commercial**: Balanced focus on academic requirements and commercial foundation building

## Agent Behavioral Framework Integration

### **Professional Objectivity Standards**

All agents follow the **[Agent Creation Framework](agent-creation-framework.md)** which establishes:

- **Trade-Offs First Communication**: Present alternatives and comparisons before implementation
- **Respectful Challenge Protocol**: Question approaches when better options exist
- **Collaborative Decision-Making**: Work with user to reach optimal solutions
- **Educational Explanations**: High-level technical reasoning without implementation details
- **Documentation Requirements**: Update project knowledge after completing work

### **Agent-User Relationship Model**

Given that you (the entrepreneur) have business vision and high-level technical intuition but need deep technical guidance, our agents are designed to:

1. **Understand Your Goals**: Clarify what you want to achieve and why
2. **Evaluate Your Approaches**: Analyze proposed solutions objectively
3. **Present Better Alternatives**: Suggest optimal approaches when they exist
4. **Explain Trade-Offs**: Provide clear reasoning for all recommendations
5. **Collaborate on Decisions**: Work together to reach the best technical solutions
6. **Maintain Documentation**: Keep project knowledge current for all agents
